She said she collected the designer toys since 2016, and at that time, the most famous designer toy is Sonny Angel, and that’s the only brand she collected. “However, suddenly there are thousands of brands coming out and I bought more and more toys from different IP, they are so cute and creative.” Miss Zhao said. She mentioned that back to several years ago, there only have cute toys on market, it looks like the designer toys are only for girls who like cute staffs, but now the image of designer toys is much more creative such as the toys for horror theme, fantasy monster and realistic like human’s organs. Miss Zhao’s favourite brand of designer toys is R2fun which is a niche brand and she collected almost all of the different piece of her favourite IP “Lumin”.</p>

          <p>Since 2017, Pop Mart started to build up yearly designer toys exhibition for collectors and artist to communicate and trade. In 2017, the exhibition invited over 100 artists and in the coming September, the exhibition for 2020 will invite over 300 different artists to come and show their IP. Nowadays, Pop Mart is not the only company which hold up designer toys exhibition, even under the influence of Covid-19, this year there are several offline designer toys exhibition in China including but not limited to the QTX, BW, TAC, QiDian, TLE, ATH which invited over hundreds of artists. There are also some designer toys online which hold through We-chat. </p>
          <p>Miss Lu, a 22-year-old college student, just start to get know about designer toys since June this year, however, she has been to 3 different offline exhibitions in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing. “Each of those exhibitions is really crowded, for example, TAC sold 6000 tickets in total for 2 days exhibition. My ticket number is around 600, so I can get in before noon. When I left around 5 o'clock, there were still people waiting in line for admission, but most of the toys are sold out.” Miss Lu said, “Everyone scrambled to buy those toys, especially for those popular brands. Most of them sold out very soon. But there are still some brands which have no one to stand by. ”</p>
          <h3>Designer toys may become a new kind of “jewellery”</h3>
          <p>In a survey conducted by Sina on consumptions of China’s young population, the data collected indicates that around 9.63% of young people have interests with art toys, which is at the same level with other traditional consumption types such as cosmetics and jewellery. </p>

          <p>For each of the exhibition Miss Lu attended, She spent at least 20 thousand RMB to buy designer toys, and for some of exhibition she needs to travel over cities means extra more money. Until now, she thinks she at least spent 300 thousand RMB in designer toys. “I bought a lot at the beginning, every toy is new and attractive to me so I can’t help to collect them all. Most of them are limited edition and sold out for years, which means I have to pay more to buy it from the secondary market. Suddenly I found out all of my savings are paid.” </p>
          <p>Miss Zhao spent 200 thousand since she started to collect designer toys. She said at first 2 years, there were not many brands, so even if she wanted to spend more money on it, there was nowhere to spend it. However, start from this year, due to more and more new and interesting brands, she spent around 10 thousand per month which is around 50% of her income. She thinks that the old collector will spend less money relatively because they have the chance to buy toys from the brand. Since most of the toys are limited, new collectors who want these toys must purchase them with high prices from the secondary market. The premium in the secondary market is very serious. Some of the prices of popular brands’ toys have even raised 10 times. </p>
          <p>As designer toys become more and more popular, there are more and more scalpers appear which build up the secondary market of designer toys.  Many scalpers are organized to scramble buying toys, which result in real collectors are harder to buy from brands and have to buy them from scalpers with high prices. Some designer toys collector will also sell their collected toys with high prices when they don't like them that much, or buy a few more in case they sell them with a high price in the future. The secondary market make newly collector paid more to get toys. However, at the same time, this also allows some people who do not have the opportunity to buy from brand because of time or location inconvenience to buy toys they like.</p>
